# Portfolio-Website
The website was designed as a personal portfolio to show off my work. As my first project ever, the website is as simple as it gets. No Frameworks were used, and some smaller portions were completed with pure HTML and CSS, although many of the more responsive elements did recquire extensive use of JavaScript.

The website still needs to be heavy refactored using the knowledge and experience I've gained since its inception, so please judge the quality of the code accordingly.
