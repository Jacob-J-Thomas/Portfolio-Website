# Portfolio-Website
My first ever programming project that still needs a lot of refactoring. Please judge the quality of the code accordingly.

The website is as simple as it gets. No Frameworks were used, and some smaller portions were completed with pure HTML and CSS, although much of the responsiveness did recquire extensive use of JavaScript.
